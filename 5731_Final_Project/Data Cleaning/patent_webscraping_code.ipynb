Neglecting the alpha channel in the encoding phase of the image and depth of single- or multiview captured scene will result in inefficient coding, which in turn will increase storage and bandwidth requirements, and impact latency.\n",
            "It is suggested in H.264 to code the alpha channel by using an auxiliary coded picture per access unit (a set of NAL units that correspond to exactly one decoded picture). These individual auxiliary pictures can be transmitted as raw information or coded as the luminance of the YUV components such as in MPEG4-Part 2.\n",
            "However, the inventors have found that alpha channel information representing transparency or depth is usually very different from the grey scale component of color images. Typically, the content is much more predictable and delimited by very accurate edges or shapes that are cannot be coded efficiently by MPEG techniques.\n",
            "Embodiments of the present invention present an extension of a typical MPEG encoder to provide hybrid encoding of the alpha channel in order to improve the compression of the alpha component for transparency/opacity signals. The main idea is to select the best coding scheme for the alpha channel(s) input(s), which includes optionally representing transparency or depth with non-MPEG compliant codecs, while the YUV channels are encoded using a MPEG-compliant encoding.\n",
            "Preferably, the coding scheme for coding the transparency/opacity signal is chosen from: lossless vector graphics encoding such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG); lossless simple mathematical/analytical representation such as gradients, piece-wise constant or linear functions; and lossless or lossy depth encoding. The use of scalable graphics or mathematical representation encoding enables a lossless coding as well as lossless geometric transformations of the alpha channel if the video has to be decoded and resized or cropped. Ultimately, lossy HEVC encoding of the alpha component as a Y-component may be selected in case the preceding methods cannot encode the alpha content with a significant compression performance measured by an âobjective rateâ.\n",
            "The âobjective rateâ used for assessing the performance of the candidate coding schemes is made dependent on the QP or rate chosen for the YUV signals compressed by the encoder. Typically the user might want to restrict the alpha channel rate to a given percentage of the total rate for the YUV channels and alpha channel.\n",
            "In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the encoder 200 is composed of an MPEG-based encoder 291 (typically, a standard H.264 encoder) that compresses YUV components, as well as a specific alternative encoding branch 250, 280, 290 for the alpha channel. The alpha channel is separately coded using hybrid encoding. To achieve this, an additional block is introduced in de codec, which is referred to as an âencoder switchâ 210, which performs a decision and selection of the type of the applicable alpha codec based on available hardware and rate statistics, and optionally former decisions:\n",
            "    Available hardware is taken into account to ensure that only coding schemes for which the required processing resources are available, may be selectedâthis check may take into account the fact that the calculations for some encoding schemes can easily be parallelized (e.g., SVG). Rate statistics (symbolically represented as storage 220 in FIG. 2) are taken into account as indicated above, to ensure that the selected coding meets predetermined performance requirements as measured and/or averaged over a certain time range. Former decisions are optionally taken into account to implement a form of âhysteresisâ, such that the alpha channel is coded in a consistent way for successive portions of the video stream, despite temporary and/or limited transgressions of the performance thresholds.   \n",
            "Preferably, specifically for the alpha channel frames corresponding to the Intra or IDR frames (start of a Group-of-Pictures a.k.a. GOP) of the H.264 encoding of the YUV components, two alternative encodings are first tested as follows. An exemplary decision tree that could be applied by the encoder switch 210 of the encoding apparatus 200 is illustrated in FIG. 1:\n",
            "    SVG picture encoding 130: the compression rate is measured and compared to the objective compression rate set for the YUV components; If 140 SVG is not good enough (in terms of compression performance): a mathematical representation encoding 160, in which the alpha channel is segmented in piecewise linear functions; If 170 the mathematical representation encoding is not good enough (in terms of compression performance): the alpha channel frame, and preferably all subsequent alpha frames of the entire GOP, are coded with an MPEG-based encoding 190.   \n",
            "SVG picture encoding 130 may provide the desired compression by relying on the presence of metadata about the way the alpha map was created. Preferably, in the absence of such metadata, the alpha map is segmented in differentiable regions, in which continuous edges are detected (for example by a Canny Edge Detector algorithm), connected edge shapes are detected, and regions separated by these shapes are then described by means of SVG descriptors.\n",
            "Likewise, the mathematical representation 160 may be obtained on the basis of metadata. Preferably, in the absence of such metadata, the alpha map is segmented in differentiable regions, in which edges are detected (both hard edges, which are non-differentiable in at least one 2D direction, and free-form transitions, which may be described by polynomials, quadrics, planes, etc.), whereupon the image can be segmented according to this edge map into continuous and differentiable regions containing no edge and specific regions for soft edge transitions. For each region, a function F(x,y,z) is fitted (e.g., a polynomial, quadric, or plane).\n",
            "Thus, a mathematical representation may be obtained which consists of a composition of implicit functions. These functions denoted F(x,y,z) are defined in the 3D space with (x,y,z) coordinates where the pair (x,y) is equal to the (i,j) pixel coordinates of the alpha pixels and the z coordinate is the alpha value at (i,j). The function F can be for example a sphere of radius r such as F(x,y,z)=x2+y2+z2âr2=0. Functions may be generalized polynomials in (x,y,z) that are totally defined by their coefficients am,n,p such that F(x,y,z) is equal to Î£m,n,pam,n,pxmynzp. The function can also be defined on a support domain described by a rectangular region in (x,y) coordinates. Composition of functions is defined by multiple functions with their respective support domains, with an appropriate rule to resolve the composite function value in points in which the constituent function domains may overlap. Preferably, the specific rule is that if an (x,y) pair receives two possible alpha values, only the highest alpha value will be associated with that (x,y) pair. The advantage of the aforementioned preferred representation is that it allows an accurate representation of smooth transitions of alpha shapes or depth values. Furthermore, in case of scaling or re-sampling of the image, the alpha channel can be recomputed without any loss in quality.\n",
            "Optionally, the encoding decisions are taken on the basis of individual slices/tiles in the alpha stream.\n",
            "The MPEG-based encoder 290 and encoding 190 may be an H.264 encoder, for instance an HEVC encoder or an H.264 SVC encoder.\n",
            "If compression performance statistics 220 are available from previous encoded GOPs, then the comparison test for compression performance may be based on the average between the median (or average) of the measured compression rate of previous frames and the compression rate of the current frame.\n",
            "If the SVG 150; 250 or mathematical function 180; 280 encoding have been selected for the first frame of the GOP (or for a particular slice/tile of said first frame), the same encoder is used until the end of the GOP. If H.264 190; 290 encoding has been selected for the first frame of the GOP, the encoding is done using H.264, but the SVG and mathematical representation encodings may still be tested in order to keep compression rate statistics.\n",
            "Preferably, the system checks whether the SVG 150; 250 or mathematical function 190; 290 encoding has been selected for a predefined minimum number of GOPS, and decides to apply the said encoding to the entire video if the predefined minimum is reached 120.\n",
            "The MPEG-based encoder 290 and encoding 190 may be an H.264 MVC encoder, in which case multiple alpha channels are available for two or more viewpoints. In such a case, the compression rates performance tests may be based on the SVG or mathematical representation encoding of all available alpha channels considered as separate channels. The MVC encoding of alpha channels follows the same inter-frame hierarchy as the one selected for the YUV channels.\n",
            "When the invention is applied to multiview streams, it is advantageous to only encode the small differences concerning the displacement of the edges in the alpha channel for different views, instead of the full alpha frame.\n",
            "Preferably, the decision of the hybrid encoder for the alpha frames as well for parts (slices/tiles) of the alpha frame is signaled in the encoded stream.\n",
            "Preferably, some or all of the encoding mechanisms described above for the alpha channel are also applied to the encoding of the depth information.\n",
            "Optionally, the alpha coded stream and the YUV coded streams are combined in a container by an aggregator 299.\n",
            "As illustrated in FIG. 3, an associated decoding apparatus 300 in accordance with the present invention, which may for example be provided in a set-top box, a home gateway, a client computer program, or integrated into visualization hardware such as a TV set, comprises a first decoder 350 for decoding portions of the transparency information channel encoded according to a lossless vector graphics encoding scheme (e.g., SVG), a second decoder 380 for decoding portions of the transparency information channel encoded according to a mathematical representation encoding scheme, a third decoder 390 for decoding portions of the transparency information channel encoded according to an MPEG-based encoding scheme, and a detector 310 arranged to detect the encoding applied to specific portions of the transparency information channel, and to submit these portions to the appropriate decoder.
